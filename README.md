  Hello, Welcome to my promtional website, if you cant already tell, im promoting my family's favourite baking recipes on youtube. That picture is me, Ons Ben Hariz or أُنس بن حريز in arabic. Im a Berber Tunisian Canadian, im of northafrican heritige, my family calls me noussa. I was born in Ben Arous Tunisia (flag above). My parents moved to montreal when I was a couple months old (im the elsdest child) until we eventually moved to edmonton when i was 4. I a sister and brother, 13 and 11. Im a virgo, born on september 6th. Fall is my favorite season just beacuse of comfy clothes and leaves. I speak english, arabic, Tunisian Darija and bigginer french. The hijab has been a part of my life for as long as i remember, as a muslim, we only have two holdiays a year and thats eid al adha and eid alfitr after ramadan,we also celebrate from time to time the islamic new year.
  I lovvvvvve playing rugby, i can be aggressive as a woman and no one will judge. in fact i was on my schools rugby and basketball teams. I also have a passion for baking if you didnt know already, reading books for days on end, playing sand-box simulation games like the Sims 4 and Stardew Vally, also knitting is pretty dope. I work at my dads Painting company, but im just a helper. I dont really like webpages will a lot of text so i tried to steer away with that in this website. biggest petpeeve is wetsocks. I have a INTJ personality type. Science is my passion, im definetly applying in S.T.E.M. in unviveristy and thats why i took this course acctually. i dont really know what feild im specifically interested in. I Hate the humanities side of subjects with a passion, i find them so hard because im not good at writing and they involve creativy :(. on the other hand the math and sciences side of things just makes sense to me, theres a formula, theres always a solution and we use logic to get it.
  
  Not many people match my energy so i have 3 friends and ive known all of them since elementary, yeah i have trust issues loll. Id say im socailly awkward but once i let people inim pretty annoying, but im quite introverted and socilly anxious, i dont like parties and tight spaces, i just like to stay home and read quietly. im not a big fan of music for no reason. im very protective and supportive of my friends,im funny,caring serious and logical. This is definetly bad but i validate my being acedemically, ive excelled most my life but every year it gets harder and thats expected. in school i help run a club with the senators called Vocies of Lazerte, we basically make the school more inclusive by organzing events and fundrasiers
