        Hello, Welcome to my promotional website. If you can't tell, I'm promoting my family's favourite baking recipes on youtube. That picture is me, Ons Ben Hariz or أُنس بن حريز in arabic and my siblings while we travlled to Djerba this summer. I'm a Berber Tunisian Canadian, I'm of North African heritage, my family calls me Noussa. I was born in Ben Arous Tunisia (flag above). My parents moved to Montreal when I was a couple months old (I'm the eldest child) until we eventually moved to Edmonton when I was 4. I have a sister and brother, 13 and 11. My sign is Virgo, born on september 6th. Fall is my favorite season just because of comfy clothes and leaves. I speak English, Arabic, Tunisian Darija and beginner French. The hijab has been a part of my life for as long as i remember, as a muslim, we only have two holdiays a year and thats eid al adha and eid alfitr after ramadan,we also celebrate from time to time the islamic new year.
        <br>I attend M.E. Lazerte High School. I love playing rugby, I can be aggressive as a woman and no one will judge. In fact I was on my school's rugby and basketball teams, our rugby team won the division two city championships this year XD. I also have a passion for baking if you didn't know already, reading books for days on end, playing sand-box simulation games like the Sims 4 and Stardew Valley, also knitting is pretty dope. I work at my dad's painting company, but I'm just a helper. My favorite color is orange. I have an addiction for flan and butterscotch pudding. I don't really like web pages with a lot of text so I tried to steer away from that on this website. The biggest pet peeve is wetsocks. I have an INTJ personality type. Science is my passion, I'm definitely applying to S.T.E.M. in university and that's why I took this course actually. I don't really know what field I'm specifically interested in. I Hate the humanities side of subjects with a passion, I find them so hard because I'm not good at writing and they involve creativity :(. on the other hand the math and sciences side of things just makes sense to me, there's a formula, there's always a solution and we use logic to get it.
        <br> Not many people match my energy so I have 3 friends and I've known all of them since elementary, yeah I have trust issues loll. I'd say I'm socially awkward but once I let people in I'm pretty annoying, but I'm quite introverted and socially anxious. I don't like parties and tight spaces, I just like to stay home and read quietly. I'm not a big fan of music for no reason. I'm very protective and supportive of my friends. I'm funny,caring, serious and logical. This is definitely bad but I validate my being academically. I've excelled most of my life but every year it gets harder and that's expected. In school I help run a club with the senators called Voices of Lazerte, we basically make the school more inclusive by organizing events and fundraisers. That's me.
